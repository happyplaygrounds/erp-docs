The following features are not available.

Features | Supported | Notes
--------|-----------|-----------
Automated Tax Calculation | No | Currently we have not found an affordable tax calculation solution. Some of the higher end solutions would most likely work but at this time we have chosen not to invest. Need some more quotes accepted in order to take the plunge ;) 
Mobile Application | No | There is no mobile application but HIIQ will work in a browser on mobile or a tablet.
