My name is Brian Collins, and I'am a swimmer, tennis player, golfer and CIO (IT guy). I quit any type of programming for 10 years and just started developing software again about 3 years ago. I had always said I would develop software again as a hobby pastime. So I guess you could say HIIQ is a hobby. I have worked in the insurance, energy, technology and now construction industries. I enjoy solving problems and improving processes which is why I wrote HIIQ. HIIQ is a work in process and if your reading this you will be a part of helping me improve the software. Who knows what we will create together and what the final product will be.

I have written a lot of software. The largest software system I wrote was a point of sale system for an oil field pipe and supply company. The system processed 2 billion dollars of sales invoices a year. Seventy five thousand payable invoices a month and fifty thousand sales invoices. I am excited about creating software to help Happy grow. 

Kelli started Happy Playgrounds in 2019 and Happy has grown exponentially year over year. It has been fun to watch and at times difficult but what business doesn't have growing pains. Glad you have joined the team.

If there's a feature you need but it isn't available here, let me know and I might add it. Thanks for using HIIQ.
