My name is Brian Collins, and I'am a swimmer, tennis player, golfer and CIO (IT guy). I enjoy solving problems and improving processes and that is why I wrote HIIQ. HIIQ is a work in process and if your reading this you will be a part of helping me improve HIIQ. Who knows what we will create and what the final product will look like.

I have written a lot of software. The largest software system I wrote was a web based and ran every aspect of an oil field pipe and supply company. The system processed 2 billion dollars of sales invoices a year at its peak. Seventy five thousand payable invoices a month and fifty thousand sales invoices. I am glad I am out of that environment and excited about creating a oftware to help Happy grow. 

Kelli started Happy Playgrounds in 2019 and it has grown exponentially year over year. It has been fun to watch and at times difficult but what business doesn't have growing pains. Glad you have joined the team.

If there's a feature you need but it isn't available here, let me know and I might add it. Thanks for using HIIQ.
