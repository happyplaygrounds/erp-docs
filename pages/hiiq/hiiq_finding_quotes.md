## Finding Quotes
There are two methods to find a quote. 

### First Method 
Is to look up the customer and then click on the quotes link to list all the quotes associated with the Happy customer. In the top bar menu the Home link and Customer link are exactly the same. Both provide the ability to search for a customer by name. 

### Second Method
The second method is to search for the quote by entering the quote number. You can find this option by clicking on the Quote link in the top bar menu and then select Search in the drop down menu.
Both of these methods display the same results which are displayed in the screen shot below.
