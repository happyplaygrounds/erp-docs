## Finding Customers
You can find customers by typing in a portion of the Customers name. There is no need to type in wild card characters. It will find your search criteria any where in the customers name (i.e beginning, middle or end). But matching the case of a word does matter. If the first letter of Customer name is capitalized the Search criteria must be capitalized as well to match. After entering your search criteria either press enter or click on the Search button.
