If you click on Happy Docs or the logo it will take you documentation for Happy Docs. If you want to return to HIIQ documentation click on Products and in the drop down select HIIQ documentation.

We will review each menu item

## Docs

The `Docs` menu is where you find documentation for Happy products. Currently there is only HIIQ documentation but there will be additional products documented. These products can range from technology, product, process, human resource, etc. Happy Docs can be a major part of our intranet in the future, the place you come for all your answers and documentation needs. 

## News

The `News` menu option allows you to stay up to date with Happy Playgrounds news and events. News is like a blog for Happy. 

## GitHub

The `GitHub` menu selection will take you to GitHub where the Happy Docs system is located. You can see all the files that make up this site and even make changed to the pages 

## HIIQ

The `HIIQ` menu selection will take you back to HIIQ where you can create quotes. Remember the Happy Docs site opened in another tab so there is most likely another tab open to HIIQ. Browser tabs take use a lot of memory so it is a good idea to close tabs you are not using.


## Feedback

The `Feedback` menu selection will send an email to me and include the page your on in the body. You will be able to add additional comments in the body of the email. 

## Nav

The `Nav` menu selection toggles the sidebar on and off.

## Search

The `Search` menu selection allows you to search the support site based on the tags associated with each page.
