My name is Brian Collins, I  have either been or currently am a swimmer, tennis player, golfer and or CIO (IT guy). In the middle of my career, I quit any type of software development for 10 years. I just started developing again about 3 years ago. Some folks like to play word games as a hobby I like solving software problems. So I guess you could say HIIQ is a hobby. I have worked in the insurance, energy, technology and now construction industries. I enjoy solving problems and improving processes which is why I wrote HIIQ. HIIQ is a work in process and if your reading this you will be a part of helping improve the software. Who knows what the finished product will look like.

I have developed a lot of software. The largest software system I wrote was a point of sale system for an oil field pipe and supply company. The system processed 2 billion dollars of sales invoices a year. Seventy five thousand payable invoices a month and fifty thousand sales invoices. I am excited about creating software to help Happy grow. 

Kelli started Happy Playgrounds in 2019 and Happy has grown exponentially year over year. It has been fun to watch and be a part of the growth. Were Happy your reading about Happy.

If there's a feature you need but it isn't available here, let me know and I might add it. Thanks for using HIIQ.
