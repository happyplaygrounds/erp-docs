We will review each menu item

## Docs

The `Docs` menu is where you find documentation for Happy products. Currently there is only HIIQ documentation but there will be additional products documented. These products can range from technology, product, process, human resource, etc. Happy Docs can be our intranet where you come for all your answers. 

## News

The `News` menu option allows you to stay up to date with Happy Playgrounds news and events. News is like a blog for Happy.

The `GitHub` menu selection will take you to GitHub where the Happy Docs system is located. You can see all the files that make up this site and even make changed to the pages 

## HIIQ

The `HIIQ` menu selection will take you back to HIIQ where you can create quotes. Remember the Happy Docs site opend in another tab so there is most likely another tab open to HIIQ. Browser tabs take use a lot of memory so it is a good idea to close tabs you are not using.
